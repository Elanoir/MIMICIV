The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV 2.2 contains EHRs of over 40,000 patients admitted multiple times to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, between 2008 and 2020, performing almost 5 million entries in the database.
This dataset is divided into two big categories: EHRs from the hospital and EHRs from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). 
The data from the hospital contains multiple .csv tables regarding admissions (hospital stays), patientsâ€™ information (gender, age, date of death), diagnostics, services that cared for the patient, laboratory measurements, prescriptions, and unit transfers, for example. 
The ICU category includes .csv tables regarding ICU admissions, information about administrations to patients and its ingredients, and all the medical procedures to which a patient was subjected during the ICU stay. 
Here, an exploratory analysis of the MIMIC-IV 2.2 database concerning hospital data can be found.
